## ***Lists***

### The three types of lists that HTML provides are : 
1. Ordered lists
2. Unordered lists
3. Definition lists


To understand how the lists is used , here are some examples:

### Ordered lists : 

#### Code :

`<ol>`
<br>`<li>This is the first item in the list</li>`
<br>`<li>This is the second item in the list</li>`
<br>`<li>This is the third item in the list</li>`
<br>`</ol>`

#### Results : 

1. This is the first item in the list
2. This is the second item in the list
3. This is the third item in the list

### Unordered lists

#### Code : 

<br>`<ul>`
<br>`<li>This is the first item in the list</li>`
<br>`<li>This is the second item in the list</li>`
<br>`<li>This is the third item in the list</li>`
<br>`</ul>`

#### Results

+ This is the first item in the list
+ This is the first item in the list
+ This is the first item in the list

### Definition lists :

#### Code :

<br>`<dl>`
<br>`<dt>The first heading</dt>`
<br>`<dd>The first paragraph</dd>`
<br>`<dt>The second heading</dt>`
<br>`<dd>The second paragraph</dd>`
<br>`<dd>The second paragraph</dd>`
<br>`<dt>The third heading</dt>`
<br>`<dt>The fourth heading</dt>`
<br>`<dd>The fourth paragragh</dd>`
<br>`</dl>`

#### Results :

<br>***The first heading***
<br>        The first paragraph
<br>***The second heading***
<br>        The second paragraph
<br>        The second paragraph
<br>***The third heading***
<br>***The fourth heading***
<br>        The fourth paragragh

## ***Boxes***

<br>In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

<br>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

<br>Explanation of the different parts:

<br>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.
<br>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
<br>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
<br>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.
<br>The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

<br>***An array is a special type of variable that contains a group of variables such as integer and string.***
### Java Script arrays example : 
const myFavDrinks = new Array("Coffee", "Pepsi", "Iced yogurt");

## ***JS decesions and loops***
JavaScript Loops and decesions are used to repeatedly run a block of code and to check if it is true or false based on a specific standards.
