The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

+ src - The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.
+ alt - The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it like someties when the internet connection get slow.

<br>The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. ***rgb values*** : These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. ***hex codes*** : These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. ***color names*** : There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan
